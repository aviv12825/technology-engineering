# Oracle Access Governance

Access Governance is a cloud native identity governance and administration (IGA) service that provides enterprisewide visibility to govern access to cloud and on-premises environments. With an intuitive user experience, dynamic access control, and a prescriptive analytics-driven access review process, it helps customers automate access provisioning, get insights into access permission and cloud infrastructure policy reviews, identify anomalies, and remediate security risks.

Oracle Access Governance enables integration with a wide range of authoritative sources (trusted source of identities and their attributes) and managed systems (applications containing account and permissions). **For the most common integration patterns, please see the [Reusable Assets Overview](#reusable-assets-overview) section below**.
