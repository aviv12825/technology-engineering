# Terraform Stack to be used in OCI Resource Manager to create OCI DevOps pipelines for OCI Functions

Reviewed: 11.2.2025
 
# When to use this asset?
 
Anyone who wants to create OCI DevOps pipelines for OCI Functions using Terraform in OCI Resource manager.
The DevOps project is not specific to any programming language but includes <a href="./files/build_pipeline_specs/">build pipeline specs</a> example files to build and deploy jvm and native Java functions. Source code for a such Function can be found <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/functions/java-helloworld-AI-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions/README.md">here</a>.

# How to use this asset?

Clone this repo locally. In OCI Console click <code>Create Stack</code> under <code>Resource Manager</code> in your project compartment. Drag-n-drop the <a href="./files">files -folder</a> to <code>Stack Configuration</code> (<b>folder type</b>).
<p>
OCI DevOps IAM Policies are not part of the stack, please refer to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/devops_iampolicies.htm">docs</a> how to create them first.
<p>
<b><i>Important!</i></b> Before running the stack it is manadatory to create the OCI Registry repository for the OCI Function container and upload a dummy X86 architecture container to it. The <b>name</b> of the OCIR repo needs to match to the <code>image_name</code> of the Stack variables e.g. <b>helloworldai-java</b>. The image tag must be '<b>1</b>'.
<br>
This can be done by doing the following in OCI Cloud Shell (assuming the image name is 'helloworldai-java'):
<pre>
oci artifacts container repository create --display-name helloworldai-java --compartment-id ocid1.compartment.oc1.....gq
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR_TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworldai-java:1
docker push fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR_TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/helloworldai-java:1
</pre>
Unless doing this the Stack will run into an error:
<pre>
Error: 400-InvalidParameter, Invalid Image fra.ocir.io/&lt;YOUR_TENANCY_NAMESPACE&gt;/&lt;image_name&gt:1 does not exist or you do not have access to use it
</pre>
After doing this the Stack can be run to create the OCI DevOps project. After the project creation the build pipelines can be run to build and deploy the OCI Function with real OCI Function code (the hello-world dummy container won't run properly).
